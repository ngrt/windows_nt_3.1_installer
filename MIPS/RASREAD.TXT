Callback
--------
Modems supported as server modems may not support callback when used as client modems.


Manual Dialing
--------------
These modems have following idiosyncrasies with manual dialing.

Modem			Idiosyncrasy
-----			------------
Bocamodem M1440		Fails modem protocol negotiation.
Gateway 2000 Telepath	Always disconnected by the server after
   Internal		   negotiation.

-----------------------------------
DIALING OUT THROUGH A SECURITY HOST
-----------------------------------

If you want to configure your server to dial out through a Security Dynamics security host, you must order two connectors through your Security Dynamics provider. Specify that you want the dial-out option when you order. The provider will then send you an AND gate and a jumper box. For the ACM/400 security host, you will also receive different software.

To install the security host:

1. Set up the host for a fixed bits per second (bps) speed rather than autobaud. The fixed bps should equal the value of the MAXCONNECTBPS parameter for the entry you created for this device in the MODEM.INF file.

2. Make sure Hardware Flow Control is set to the default, on. See "Setting Modem Features" in the Remote Access online help.


----
ISDN
----

This information supplements "Configuring for ISDN " in the Remote Access online help.


Adding ISDN Ports
-----------------
If you are installing more than one ISDN card, you must restart your computer after you have installed the ISDN drivers. Otherwise, all available ISDN ports may not show up when you configure Remote Access for ISDN.


"No Answer" Error Message
-------------------------
When you dial through ISDN and fail to connect, the error message "No answer" appears. This message can mean one of several things may be wrong. For example:

o  The Remote Access server did not answer because it was turned off, the modem wasn't connected, or so on. Contact your system administrator.
o  The line is busy.
o  There's a problem with your hardware. Make sure your ISDN cards have been installed and configured correctly.
o  A poor line condition, such as too much static, interrupted your connection. Wait a few minutes and try dialing again.
o  You did not enable line-type negotiation in the ISDN Settings dialog box, and a connection could not be made with the line type you chose in the ISDN Settings dialog box.
o  Your ISDN switching facility may be busy. Try again later.

Check for any of these potential problems. When you have fixed the problem, redial the number.


PCIMAC-ISA DigiBoard Card
-------------------------
Older DigiBoard cards don't work on some computers. If you don't have the latest PCIMAC-ISA DigiBoard card, serial number A14308 or greater, contact DigiBoard for a replacement.


--------------------
X.25 PAD.INF Entries
--------------------

There are two SprintNet entries in PAD.INF, SprintNet, Standard, and SprintNet, Alternate. Generally, if you are calling through 9600- bits-per-second (bps) or faster dialup PADs, try SprintNet, Standard. If you are calling through 2400-bps or slower dialup PADs, try SprintNet, Alternate.

If one SprintNet entry fails to connect reliably, try the other one.  SprintNet dialup PADs should work with one or the other, but there is not a hard, fast rule for which one to choose.


-----------------------------------
SETTING ASYNCMAC TIMEOUT PARAMETERS
-----------------------------------

If you are experiencing an abnormal number of timeout errors (more than 10 per 100 kilobytes received), try increasing the TimeoutBase value from 500 to 1000 if one of the following is true:

o Your computer has a security device.

o Your computer's modems have hardware compression or error control enabled. 

Note:  With TimeoutBase increased to 1000, network functionality may on rare occasions act abnormally. For example, you may have to type network commands more than once, or functionality may periodically slow down.

Add this parameter to the Windows NT Registry on the following path:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\AsyncMacn\Parameters

Note:  The n in AsyncMacn stands for a number. Look for this parameter under AsyncMac01, AsyncMac02, and so on.


----------------------------
THE RAWIOTIMELIMIT PARAMETER
----------------------------

This information supplements the Remote Access administrator's guide, Appendix C, "Modifying Parameters."

The RawIoTimeLimit parameter lets the redirector send data in 64 kilobyte blocks. With RawIoTimeLimit turned on, throughput increases by 10-15 percent. But, while communicating at this speed, all other simultaneous data transfers are blocked.

By default, this parameter is turned off for slow links and on for faster links. For example, if you are communicating at 14,400 bps or slower, this feature is turned off. But if you are communicating at faster speeds, such as through an ISDN line, this feature is turned on.

The following list shows what values turn raw I/O on and off for ISDN connections:

With RawIoTimeLimit set to 9:
    Raw I/O is enabled when connected through one 64K channel.
    Raw I/O is enabled when connected through two 64K channels.

With RawIoTimeLimit set to 5 (default):
    Raw I/O is disabled when connected through one 64K channel.
    Raw I/O is enabled when connected through two 64K channels.

With RawIoTimeLimit set to 0:
    Raw I/O is disabled when connected through one 64K channel.
    Raw I/O is disabled when connected through two 64K channels.

The RawIoTimeLimit parameter is in the Registry, on the following path:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Rdr\Parameters


-----------------------------------------------
COMMAND-LINE ADMINISTRATOR'S UTILITY (RASADMIN)
-----------------------------------------------

This section tells how to invoke the Remote Access Administrator's utility from the command line.


Syntax
------

	rasadmin [domainname | servername] [/l] [/h]

where
-----

domainname	The domain you want to administer.

servername	The server you want to administer.

/l (letter L)	Sets the Administrator's utility to operate in
		the low-speed connection mode. This option disables
		browsing for domains and user names, which can take
		a long time over a telephone line. For better
		performance, set this option when you do not need to
		browse for servers or users.

/h		Sets the Administrator's utility to operate in the
		default connection mode, high-speed. This option
		enables browsing for domains and user names.
		

Remarks
-------

You can specify either a domain name or a server name, but not both.

The mode of operation (low- or high-speed) for each domain or server you have previously selected is saved in the Registry. So, if you need to change the previous setting from a low speed to a high speed connection, you must specify /h as a parameter to rasadmin.


Example
-------

To administer a server named NT_SERVER01 over a low-speed connection, type the following on the command line:

	rasadmin \\nt_server01 /l
